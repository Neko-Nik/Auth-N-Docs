# Relations in Database Schema

Understanding the relationships between tables in a database schema is crucial for designing efficient and effective data models. This page explains the concept of relations in a database schema, focusing on the different types of relationships and how they are implemented in a relational database.

## Database Schema for User Roles and Permissions

Each role has a set of permissions associated with it, and users are assigned roles that grant them specific permissions. The database schema for user roles and permissions consists of several tables that capture this relationship effectively. Below are the key tables and their relationships in the schema:

### Roles Table
   - This table stores information about different roles within the system.
   - Each role is identified by a unique `role_id`, which serves as the primary key.
   - `role_name` field represents the name of the role.
   - `description` field provides a brief description of the role.
   - `created_at` field indicates the timestamp when the role was created.

### Permissions Table
   - This table contains details about various permissions that can be assigned to roles.
   - Each permission is identified by a unique `permission_id`, serving as the primary key.
   - `permission_name` field stores the name of the permission.
   - `description` field gives a description of what the permission allows.
   - `created_at` and `updated_at` fields track the timestamps of creation and last update.
   - `permission_data` field allows storing additional data related to the permission in JSON format, using key-value pairs.

### User_Roles Table
   - This table establishes the relationship between users and roles, representing which roles are assigned to which users.
   - It has a composite primary key consisting of `user_id` and `role_id`, acting as foreign keys referencing the `Users` and `Roles` tables respectively.
   - `assigned_by` field contains the user ID of the person who assigned the role.
   - `assigned_at` field denotes the timestamp when the role was assigned to the user.

### Role_Permissions Table
   - This table defines the association between roles and permissions, indicating which permissions are assigned to which roles.
   - It has a composite primary key consisting of `role_id` and `permission_id`, which are foreign keys referencing the `Roles` and `Permissions` tables respectively.
   - `assigned_by` field holds the user ID of the person who assigned the permission to the role.
   - `assigned_at` field specifies the timestamp when the permission was assigned to the role.

These tables and their relationships allow for the management of roles, permissions, and their assignments to users effectively within the system.

:::info Key Takeaways
- Understanding the relationships between tables in a database schema is essential for designing efficient data models.
- The database schema for user roles and permissions consists of tables like `Roles`, `Permissions`, `User_Roles`, and `Role_Permissions`.
- The relationships between these tables help in managing roles, permissions, and their assignments to users effectively.
