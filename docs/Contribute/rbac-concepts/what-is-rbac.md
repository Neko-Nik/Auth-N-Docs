# What is RBAC?

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a policy-neutral access control mechanism defined around roles and privileges. The components of RBAC such as role-permissions, user-role and role-role relationships make it simple to perform user assignments. RBAC is a widely used access control model that is employed in various applications and systems.

:::tip Tip
    RBAC is a powerful and flexible access control model that can be used to manage permissions in a system. It is a simple and scalable model that can be used to manage access control in a system. So, it is important to understand the key concepts of RBAC to effectively manage access control in a system.

## Key Concepts

The key concepts of Role-Based Access Control are as follows:

- **Role**: A role is a collection of permissions that can be assigned to users. Roles are used to group users with similar access rights.

- **Permission**: A permission is a right to perform an operation on a resource. Permissions are assigned to roles.

- **User**: A user is an entity that can be assigned to one or more roles. Users are granted access rights based on the roles they are assigned.

- **Resource**: A resource is an object that a user wants to access. Resources in this case will be the API endpoints.

:::info Note
    In RBAC, users are not assigned permissions directly. Instead, users are assigned to roles, and roles are assigned permissions.
